Change history for django-templateselector
------------------------------------------


?next?
^^^^^^
* Automatic deployment of new releases from Travis mostly worked, but the
  ``sdist`` is in poor shape (see commit ``44ad2a1542f2f61a73de84e0f7213bccfdb6f265``)
  so I've disabled that for now. Wheels are better anyway, right?


0.2.0
^^^^^^

* Fixed issue where the "same" template could show up more than once in the
  widget, which wouldn't be possible when using ``get_template``
* If the form field (``TemplateChoiceField``) has only **one** valid template
  option, and the form is unbound (ie: its an **add** form or whatever) then
  pre-select the valid choice. Only happens if the field has ``required=True``
* using the ``get_<fieldname>_display`` as a value in a ```ModelAdmin.list_display``
  will now allow for sorting by the underlying value in the database.
* if the ``<fieldname>`` is used as part of a ``ModelAdmin.list_filter`` it will
  show the nice display names of any used templates, rather than their internal
  path representation.
  
0.1.1
^^^^^^
* First release on PyPI.

0.1.0
^^^^^
* Initial development.
