Change history for django-templateselector
------------------------------------------

0.2.5
^^^^^^
* |FIX| Added ``:focus`` visual styles so that keyboard navigation through a form
  including the widget may now indicate when selecting items.

0.2.4
^^^^^^
* |NEW| Added a `system check`_ to ensure that the templates and styles are
  able to be loaded.


0.2.3
^^^^^^
* |FIX| Change the model level field validation (``TemplateField(match=...)`` to
  forcibly check the given value matches the regex, in addition to checking
  whether the given value exists in one of the template loaders.
* |META| Still trying to master automatic deployment from Travis. One day I'll
  get sdist working again!

0.2.2
^^^^^^
* |META| Still trying to master automatic deployment from Travis. No
  functionality change since ``0.2.0``


0.2.1
^^^^^^
* |META| Automatic deployment of new releases from Travis mostly worked, but the
  ``sdist`` is in poor shape (see commit ``44ad2a1542f2f61a73de84e0f7213bccfdb6f265``)
  so I've disabled that for now. Wheels are better anyway, right? No
  functionality change since ``0.2.0``


0.2.0
^^^^^^

* |FIX| prevent the "same" template showing up more than once in the
  widget, which wouldn't be possible when using ``get_template`` (`#1`_)
* |NEW| If the form field (``TemplateChoiceField``) has only **one** valid template
  option, and the form is unbound (ie: its an **add** form or whatever) then
  pre-select the valid choice. Only happens if the field has ``required=True``
* |NEW| using the ``get_<fieldname>_display`` as a value in a ```ModelAdmin.list_display``
  will now allow for sorting by the underlying value in the database. (`#2`_)
* |NEW| if the ``<fieldname>`` is used as part of a ``ModelAdmin.list_filter`` it will
  show the nice display names of any used templates, rather than their internal
  path representation. (`#3`_)
  
0.1.1
^^^^^^
* |META| First release on PyPI.

0.1.0
^^^^^
* |META| Initial development.
